This is the README file for IO::File::Multi (v 1.02), a simple module to
handle printing to multiple (output) filehandles, with single print() or
printf() calls.

Requires: IO::File (and it's requirements)

Installation:  You should know the routine by now...
	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

If for some reason MakeMaker is broken or you have a personal problem with
the make command (seek help), you can just copy Multi.pm into your perl
site directory and everything should be okay.

#!/local/bin/perl
use IO::File::Multi;
$mh1 = new IO::File::Multi;
$mh1->open(">-");	# print to stdout
$mh1->open("| lpr");	# print to hard-copy printer
$mh1->open(">>log");	# append to log file
$mh1->print("This line goes to multiple places!\n");
$mh1->printf("This is just a number: %2.2f\n", 12.535632);
$mh1->close();		# close all filehandles
